# World-Weather-Analysis

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to collect weather data across the cities worldwide. Based on client's temperature preferences, a list of travel destinations will be offered along with hotel options. 
The itinerary portion of the project focuses on providing driving directions connecting the selected cities.

## Method
For this project I created a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process entailed collecting data via google APIs, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
